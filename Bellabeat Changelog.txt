Changelog:

Cleaned and checked data for both folders on their respective Excel csv files through simple filtering and manual checking.

Uploaded csv files on to Microsoft SQL Server.

Began by first making sure all files were uploaded successfully and appropriately named.

Query to join tables:
SELECT MA.Id, MA.date, MA.WeightPounds, AM.column1, AM.Date, AM.WeightPounds, AM.Fat, MA.Fat
FROM weightLogInfo_merged_March_April AS MA 
LEFT JOIN weightLogInfo_merged AS AM
ON MA.Id = AM.column1


First checked on differences between weight log info
 Only 31%  of users used the weight log feature between March-April and only 24% used it between April-May

Following code was used to check for differences in any increase, decrease or maintenance of weight between datasets.

SELECT MA.Id, MA.date, MA.WeightPounds, MA.BMI, AM.column1, AM.Date, AM.WeightPounds, AM.BMI
FROM weightLogInfo_merged_March_April AS MA 
LEFT JOIN weightLogInfo_merged AS AM
ON MA.Id = AM.column1
WHERE AM.WeightPounds > MA.WeightPounds 

Code was altered to check for "<=" as well.

Following code used to count the number of users with changes

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Id) AS MA_weight_change, COUNT(DISTINCT column1) AS AM_weight_change
FROM weightLogInfo_merged_March_April AS MA 
LEFT JOIN weightLogInfo_merged AS AM
ON MA.Id = AM.column1
WHERE AM.WeightPounds > MA.WeightPounds

Similarly altered code to check for "<=" numbers.

This next SQL query was used to find how many users actually had data in the Fat field.

SELECT MA.Id, MA.date, MA.WeightPounds, AM.column1, AM.Date, AM.WeightPounds, AM.Fat, MA.Fat
FROM weightLogInfo_merged_March_April AS MA 
LEFT JOIN weightLogInfo_merged AS AM
ON MA.Id = AM.column1
WHERE MA.Fat IS NOT NULL

Only 2 users have data in the Fat field. 

Moving on to Sleep data

This query was used to find the average difference between the fields "Total Time in Bed" and "Total Minutes Asleep" to find on average how long does it take for fitbit users to fall asleep. 

SELECT AVG(TotalTimeInBed - TotalMinutesAsleep) AS 'Going to sleep difference'
FROM sleepDay_merged

Results showed the average time it takes for users to fall asleep is 39 minutes.

SELECT AVG(TotalMinutesAsleep) AS 'Avg minutes asleep'
FROM sleepDay_merged

Resulted n 419 minutes of average minutes asleep 

Moving on to daily activities dataset:

Quickly we notice there isn't much valuable data in the LoggedActivitiesDistance field and use the following query:

SELECT COUNT(id)
FROM dailyActivity_merged_March_April
WHERE LoggedActivitiesDistance > 0 

Only 24 entries with only 6 users having used the activities logged feature. That is a mere 17% for the March to April dataset. 
The April - May dataset has no entries at all.

Using the hourCalories dataset I used the following query to check if there is substantial data with the asked for amount of calories:

SELECT *
FROM hourlyCalories_merged_March_April
WHERE Calories > 200

Throughout most of the day, users will have burnt about 95 calories every hour:

SELECT 
	AVG(MA.Calories) AS Avgcalories_March, 
	AVG(AM.Calories) AS Avgcalories_April
FROM hourlyCalories_merged_March_April AS MA
LEFT JOIN hourlyCalories_merged AS AM
ON MA.Id = AM.Id

So when analyzing a set hour or more where the calories burnt are greater than 200, it can be assumed that the user is exercising/working out at that hour.
